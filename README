Overview
--------

sb, the SCO Breaker, generates serial numbers, activation keys and
registration keys for SCO products, such as UnixWare 7.1.4.

It still works for versions released after SCO was acquired by Xinuos.
Products made by Xinuos themselves (namely OpenServer 10) do not employ any
kind of DRM.

Installation
------------

    $ make
    $ install -s sb /usr/local/bin
    $ install -m 0644 doc/sb.1 /usr/local/man/man1

The install step is optional; sb does not depend on any files and can thus be
run from any directory.

Usage and Documentation
-----------------------

See doc/sb.1 for using sb and doc/drm.ms for a description of the DRM
mechanisms employed by SCO.

For those with no access to troff implementation, a PDF version of the
documents have been included.

Motivation
----------

UNIX wants to be free.
It's an integral part of the UNIX experience to be able to read and understand
the source code of the system.
If you haven't done so yet, use something from the V6 through 4.4BSD era.
You'll see what I mean.

So this is a very elaborate "Fuck you" to SCO.
I hope it's to your liking.
